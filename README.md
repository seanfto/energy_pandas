# Energy Pandas
A data science Python Notebook for exploration of BP energy data

Each year BP publishes a Statistical Review of World Energy, freely available at

https://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/energy-economics/statistical-review-of-world-energy.html

## Notes
The `environment.yml` file should list all Python libraries on which the notebooks
depend, specified as though they were created using the following `conda` commands:

```
conda activate example-environment
conda install <pkg>=<version>
conda env export -f environment.yml
```

Note that the only libraries available to you will be the ones specified in
the `environment.yml`, so be sure to include everything else that you need!
